With this repository I want to track the Linux support on the Huawei
Matebook 13.

*This repository is inspired by lidel's repository about the Huawei Matebook X
(2017). Check out
[lidel](https://github.com/lidel/linux-on-huawei-matebook-x-2017) on GitHub.*

** Background
The Huawei Matebook 13 is by now a fairly new device. It ships with regular
Windows 10. Information about Linux support is sparse. In this repository I want
to collect some data about things that work and things that don't work.

** Contribution
If you found something which is not covered in this repository or if you use
another distro or if you found a typo, please fork, write down your notes and
create a pull request.
