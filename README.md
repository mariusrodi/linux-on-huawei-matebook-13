# GNU/Linux on Huawei Matebook 13 (2019)
With this repository I want to track the Linux support on the Huawei Matebook 13.

***This repository is inspired by lidel's repository about the Huawei Matebook X (2017). Check out [lidel](https://github.com/lidel/linux-on-huawei-matebook-x-2017) on GitHub.***

## Background
The Huawei Matebook 13 is by now a fairly new device. It ships with regular Windows 10. Information about Linux support is sparse. In this repository I want to collect some data about things that work and things that don't work. 

If you found something which is not covered in this repository or if you use another distro or if you found a typo, please fork, write down your notes and create a pull request.
